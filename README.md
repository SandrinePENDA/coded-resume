# CV-Web - version improved


## Objective
Build my CV Resume with web langages as HTML, CSS, PHP (and JavaScript, my own decision)  considering the instructions of bb&b agency.

## My process

Step-1: creating a repository on my GitHub account and cloning it in my local environnement. 

Step-2: setting up the project environment (tree structure, Bootstrap 5, images, etc.). 

Step-2: I drew and cut out the model on a piece of paper, mentioning the semantic tag for each block. This made it easy to write down the structure of the web page.

Step-3: save on Github (commit and push) what has been done so far, including the index.html file with the coded CV header. 

Step-4: let's continuing coding ... :)
