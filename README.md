# CV - web version


## Objective
Building my curriculum using web languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. PHP is used to manage a small form on the dedicated page.

## My process

Step-1: creating a repository on my GitHub account and cloning it in my local environnement. 

Step-2: I drew and cut out the model on a piece of paper, mentioning the semantic tag for each block. This made it easy to write down the HTML structure of the web page.

Step-3: setting up the project environment (Bootstrap 5, images, icons, etc.). 

Step-4: saving it on my Github repository  (commit and push) what has been done so far, including the index.html file with the coded CV header. 

Step-5: continue coding and commit changes ... :)
